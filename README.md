## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the latest version of [Docker üê≥](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

If you're on a Mac, you won't be able to install the infini-gram library locally. (It'll work in the docker-compose though!) To install other dependencies, install dependencies from `api/requirements/common-requirements.txt` instead of from `api/requirements.txt`.

`pip install -r requirements/common-requirements.txt`

### Adding an index for local development

1. Ensure you have the `aws` cli installed. run `brew install awscli` if you don't.
2. Download the `v4_pileval_llama` index by running `./bin/download-infini-gram-array.sh`

The `infinigram-array` folder is mounted to the Docker container for the API through the `docker-compose`. 

## Adding a new infini-gram index

### On the prod server

TODO

### Locally

1. Add the ID of the index to `AvailableInfiniGramIndexId` in `api/src/infinigram/index_mappings.py`
2. Add the ID as a string to `IndexMappings` in `api/src/infinigram/index_mappings.py`
3. Add the tokenizer and index directory to `index_mappings` in `api/src/infinigram/index_mappings.py`
4. add a line in /bin/download-infini-gram-array.sh to make a new symlink with that array's path. The path will be the `index_dir` you added in `index_mappings` but has `/mnt/infinigram-array` replaced with `$INFINIGRAM_ARRAY_DIR`
5. Add a mount in `docker-compose.yaml`: `- ./infinigram-array/<ARRAY_PATH_NAME>:/mnt/infinigram-array/<ARRAY_PATH_NAME>
